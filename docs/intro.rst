Introduction

In this lab, you will see DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT)
queries proxied in both directions. That is, traditional DNS queries
will be proxied to backend DoT/DoH servers,

as well as DoH/DoT queries being proxied to traditional DNS servers.

DoT is "simpler" to proxy as the original DNS protocol is simply
encapsulated in TLS using client-SSL (DoT-to-DNS) or server-ssl
(DNS-to-DoT) profiles.

DoH is a bit more complex as we must take the DNS request and
encapsulate it into a binary HTTPS payload (DNS-to-DoH) or extract the
binary payload and convert it into a traditional DNS query (DoH-to-DNS).

We will use the power of iRulesLX to handle this advanced task. Native
functionality will be available in a near-future release of TMOS so that
the iRules will not be necessary.
